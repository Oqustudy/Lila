  abstract	= "The problem of designing NLP solvers for math word
		  problems (MWP) has seen sustained research activity and
		  steady gains in the test accuracy. Since existing solvers
		  achieve high performance on the benchmark datasets for
		  elementary level MWPs containing one-unknown arithmetic
		  word problems, such problems are often considered
		  {``}solved{''} with the bulk of research attention moving
		  to more complex MWPs. In this paper, we restrict our
		  attention to English MWPs taught in grades four and lower.
		  We provide strong evidence that the existing MWP solvers
		  rely on shallow heuristics to achieve high performance on
		  the benchmark datasets. To this end, we show that MWP
		  solvers that do not have access to the question asked in
		  the MWP can still solve a large fraction of MWPs.
		  Similarly, models that treat MWPs as bag-of-words can also
		  achieve surprisingly high accuracy. Further, we introduce a
		  challenge dataset, SVAMP, created by applying carefully
		  chosen variations over examples sampled from existing
		  datasets. The best accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art
		  models is substantially lower on SVAMP, thus showing that
		  much remains to be done even for the simplest of the MWPs."
